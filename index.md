Hello World, this is exprexxo<br>
<br>

         Do 100 i = 14, 21     <br>
             write(*,*) 'Counting ', i<br>
   100   continue<br>
<br>
   I first learned to code in fortran on a DEC10<br>
   Next Cobol on a IBM3090<br>
   Then C on a PDP 11<br>
   C++ on VAX<br>
   Basic on a Atari 400 ( and 6502 ML)<br>
<br>
   A zillion lines later 10 plus languages later, I love javascript, processing, and python  <br>
<br>
   Coding is expressiveness at its best.  Better than paint or clay<br>
<br>
   Hope you have a release today
