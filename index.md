Hello World, this is exprexxo


         Do 100 i = 14, 21
             write(*,*) 'Counting ', i
   100   continue

   I first learned to code in fortran on a DEC10
   Next Cobol on a IBM3090
   Then C on a PDP 11
   C++ on VAX
   Basic on a Atari 400 ( and 6502 ML)

   A zillion lines later 10 plus languages later, I love javascript, processing, and python

   Coding is expressiveness at its best.  Better than paint or clay

   Hope you have a release today
