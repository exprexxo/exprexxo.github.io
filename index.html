Hello World, this is exprexxo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Do 100 i = 14, 21     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             write(*,*) 'Counting ', i<br>
&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue<br>
<br>
   I first learned to code in fortran on a DEC10<br>
   Next Cobol on a IBM3090<br>
   Then C on a PDP 11<br>
   C++ on VAX<br>
   Basic on a Atari 400 ( and 6502 ML)<br>
<br>
   A zillion lines later 10+ languages later you know you could know any language if you had to ... <br>
   But with time, I love javascript for its near live coding, processing for its images, and python for its philosopy  <br>
<br>
   Coding is expressiveness at its best.  Better than paint or clay<br>
<br>
   Hope you have a release today
   </p>
